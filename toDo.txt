So far, this is the order for departure:
    - The driver logs in
    - The store info and seal are entered
    - Either the driver or the gaurd enter their info
    - Driver then enters store arival, depart, and yard arival
    - Magic

Next step:
    - draw route info from drivers log instead of route info
    - clean up the UI
    - Make popups for store departue that show problems
